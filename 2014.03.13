Peter Todd:

1) Attended the Financial Crypt 2014 conference last week; lots of good discussion
   and connecting with the academics researching decentralized consensus.
   Notable highlights of the discussions: scalability/miner incentives w/
   selfish mining team, and proof-of-publication as part of decentralized
   reputation and reviews. (see #bitcoin-dev discussion today, 2014-03-13 with
   shesek for a quick summary; should writeup a more formal report)

2) Omniwallet login protocol review; related: writing general report on
   exchange security, as well as another one on proof-of-reserves.

3) Bitcoin dev work: Wrote pull-req's #3860, #3861, #3843, related to testing
   and multisig transactions; removes limits on multisig usage.

4) Finally, see my "how am I contributing?" post:
