Peter Todd:

1) Omniwallet code-signing - ongoing effort to get people signing the code.
   Also, congrats!

2) Tree-chains - more work actually writing up the paper. Also spent some time
   studying the recent chain-to-chain fund transfer stuff being worked on by
   gmaxwell and many others.

3) Bitcoin dev work: released python-bitcoinlib v0.1, BIPs work,
   OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY discussion. (the latter could be used in the future
   to lock a txout until some time is reached)
