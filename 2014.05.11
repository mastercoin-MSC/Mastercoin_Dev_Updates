Mastercoin Weekly Dev Update for March 13, 2014
J.R.: dEX goes live at block #290630! Everyone should be testing!

Omniwallet Team
	Reworked login & security.
	Increased support for DeX.
	Beginning to clean up UI and address bugs reported in github issue tracker.





Mastercoin Weekly Dev Update for March 6, 2014

Omniwallet Team
	Reworking login & security.
	Improvements to sending reliability.
            Reworking trade page 
            Develop a test plan with regards to UI and functionality
J.R.: Sorry Ryan - the team is just totally slammed right now. Please at least mention Zathras’ new  MasterChest wallet release, which now supports distributed exchange of Test MSC vs BTC. Also, his wallet now comes with a pre-seeded database of MSC transactions, so it shouldn’t take hours to sync up anymore. Bitoy’s MyMastercoins wallet has also been updated with numerous bugfixes. The main message needs to be that distributed exchange is testable on those platforms as well as on demo.masterchain.info, and we need people trying out them and Omniwallet. Please give our apologies to the readers of the dev update. With so many people helping with the hack-a-thon and racing towards the dEX deadline, it’s really hard to get coherent updates from everyone.

Mastercoin Weekly Dev Update for Feb 28th, 2014

Marv
Test reqs for Simple Send, Sell MSC for BTC, Purchase MSC with BTC ready for devs and testers to tailor for each client
Working on test results capture with Adam using Google forms
Informal omniwallet testing
More spec work with J.R., Craig, Peter

Adam
Continuing to try and work with the various exchanges (anxpro, vaultofsatoshi,bitfinex, holytransaction) to get Mastercoin listed. Several exchanges have encountered delays/slowdowns due to the bitcoin industry over the past few weeks. Also have been working with Marv to get a MSC Client test result reporting form built up and made available for testers to report their findings. 

J.R.
Tons of work on the spec, especially in regards to Smart Property. Most important change is the addition of kickstarter-style fundraisers modeled after the Mastercoin fundraiser, where the number of property tokens created are in proportion to the amount of funds raised from investors. The spec for Smart Property is now ready to be coded (pull request #52 has been merged to the master spec). Also streamlined our $100k/month milestone bounty process to use Google Forms for collecting work summaries and peer evaluations.

Zathras
* Released first public alpha of the wallet (sans DEx module)
* Large number of bugfixes across library, wallet and engine
* Consensus system fixed
* Rewriting DEx state processing to accommodate all recent changes/clarifications
* Worth mentioning adding Appendix E perhaps, though not specifically dev related

Peter
Continuing on tree-chains, spec work, testing. Updated python-bitcoinlib with more functionality; would be useful to use it to give an example of making up blockchains for use w/ testnet/regtest for unit testing confirmation and reorg related behavior. (also required for my obligations to Litecoin re: pruning)
Will be attending the Financial Crypto Conference March 3-7th

Omniwallet Team
New omniwallet release tomorrow, including:
Early trading interface
Revised wallet display & address details
account creation by email address
backend wallet persistence
UI/UX improvements to OW Trade/History pages
Merged History pages, Trade pages
Transaction Sign/Send implemented
Trade History page, updates to Offers data API endpoint


Mastercoin Weekly Dev Update, Feb 20th, 2014
Maran
Did nothing, sick :(

J.R.
Serious set of spec updates aimed at our upcoming Smart Property feature. Half of the dev MSC we owe people distributed (other half coming soon). Used Zathras’ wallet for this, which worked great.

Zathras
This is J.R. I know Zathras is finishing up his last day of work and probably won’t be able to post an update. I know that his first order of business on Monday (his first full-time day with us) will be to update his github repo and get a version of his wallet posted for public testing!

Talking to Crowdcurity.com about crowd sourced testing
Reviewed JR’s PR #52 for the spec
Introduced a few team members to Sococo, more tomorrow

Peter

In addition to the usual advisory role items I’ve started work on a paper for my “Tree Chains” idea to make blockchains more scalable via sharding the transaction space so that no one node or miner needs to process the entire blockchain. You can follow progress at http://github.com/petertodd/tree-chains-paper

Mastercoind
We have created the first database layer for Mastercoind. It's a LevelDB layer that has two uses after this week.
We save the raw Bitcoin transactions that have references to Exodus which get from our full validating node and save those in raw format by encoding them to binary streams. We added a feature so that we can give a flag to mastercoind to playback this raw data and reparse all transactions without needing to resync the whole blockchain.
We also made a second database this week to use as super fast balance lookup. The way the initial version will work is that there is lightweight balance ledger that holds all adresses as keys and their matching balances as values in the form of a hashmap: {1: 39, 2: 393}. In the future more currency ids can be easily added here.
We added support to decode Simple Sends, next to the support we already had for Fundraiser decoding
Balance is correctly calculated for both Fundraiser and Simple Send transactions.

We will have a very alpha release out hopefully around the 21st of February, with focus purely on a Simple Send read only balance.

cmlacy & omniwallet crew:
We have stage 1 features complete:  (https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/omniwallet/tree/master/design#stage-1-features)
We are pulling together a VM for ANX.hk and others, waiting on write access to MSC dropbox.
Stage 2 deadline is the 15th of Feb (https://github.com/mastercoin-MSC/omniwallet/tree/master/design#stage-2-features)
Demo server is running at https://omniwallet.labs.engine.co - as the project develops, you can try it out there.
POST endpoints are documented: https://github.com/curtislacy/omniwallet/blob/Document-API/README.md#api
UI improvements and more incoming

Marv
I made a lot of updates to the spec - formatting, transaction descriptions, versioning. These will be broken out into separate PRs. Also, see JR’s note below. Got a lot of questions answered and resolved several issues.

JR
We hashed out a lot of spec issues for future features in a very productive conference call between Craig, Marv, Peter, and myself. I have several spec changes (affecting future features) to make, and I’m trying to get a big distribution of dev MSC ready to go out the door to all previous bounty winners. I also designed an extremely low-rent explainer video presentation I hope to record soon to hold us over until we have something more professional.
