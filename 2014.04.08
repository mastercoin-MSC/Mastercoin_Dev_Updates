1) Visited the Ethereum Hackerspace in Switzerland. Got to know Ethereum team
   and their plans, and in addition we prototyped a OpenPGP extension to
   authenticate crypto-currency payments via PGP.

   Hilariously Taylor Gerring, who also works for Hive Wallet, didn't tell me I
   was visiting the Ethereum hackerspace beforehand; I had assumed he was
   referring to the Hive Wallet team. I didn't realize it until literally when
   I walked through the front door!

2) MaidSafe deployment discussion.

3) Visited NY Inside Bitcoins conference.
