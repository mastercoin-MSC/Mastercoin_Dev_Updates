Peter Todd:

1) Replace-by-fee: Spent the large majority of my time taking advantage of the
   Bitundo service's launch to write and deploy replace-by-fee, study the
   existing dangers of zeroconf transactions, and finally ensure that Mike
   Hearn's coinbase blacklisting/coinbase reallocation proposals were
   adequately rebutted.

2) Umm, I'm not actually sure I did anything else. :)
